This program will dump out your calculated sub points to a text file to be displayed with something like OBS.

Edit the settings file to your liking. You must include your broadcaster ID and oAuth code. 

You can generate your oAuth using: https://twitchapps.com/tokengen/

They do not get your oAuth token (and neither do I for that matter), it makes the call in your browser only.

You need Java installed.

If you build it yourself, run it with:
  java -jar subPointsCalculator.jar
  
Otherwise if you use a release, there are runnables.
